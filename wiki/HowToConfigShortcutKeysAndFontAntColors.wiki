= Introduction =

There is a config file.


= Details =

go to dir user's-home-dir/.neoeedit/
you will find a file data.py.verX,
if more than one such files exists(it may happens when big changes in config file due to version upgrade), the file with largest X is currently used.

you can edit it. it is self-documented, so you are expected to understand it.

the file is basically legal to python's data structure.
however if you massed the file up, you can delete it, so it will be regenerated automatically and you can start it over.
